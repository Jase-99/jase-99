            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="intro">I'm keen to promote healthier lifestyles, in creating different technologies to
                innovate the way
                users see
                fitness.
                When I was young I enjoyed seeing how things worked, this lead to my interest in IT, as years
                went on I
                gained an
                interest in health and fitness. Motivated to change the way everyday people see fitness I wanted
                to further
                study IT and
                learn how I can make a difference. Throughout my degree I have been able to work in teams which
                further
                developed my
                leadership skills as well as my time management skills.</p>

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>My programming journey began in my later years while I was at Swinburne University, where I found
                    a passion, being in my final year of my degree it didn't make sense to switch majors so I
                    completed my networking technology major and decided to go the self taught route for web
                    development with the foundational skills taught by Swinburne.</p>

                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p>One of my other passions is Photography, love to get outside and take photos, lately I've been
                    trying my hand in videography which presents its own set of challenges. I enjoy taking photos of
                    nature and aim to explore many countries taking photos along the way.</p>
