    <p>I'm keen to promote healthier lifestyles, in creating different technologies to innovate the way users see fitness.
        When I was young I enjoyed seeing how things worked, this lead to my interest in IT, as years went on I gained an interest in health and fitness. Motivated to change the way everyday people see fitness I wanted to further study IT and learn how I can make a difference. Throughout my degree I have been able to work in teams which further developed my leadership skills as well as my time management skills.
